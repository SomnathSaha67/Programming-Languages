1. **simple_calculator.py** – Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers    
2. **area_of_circle.py** – Calculate area of a circle using the `math` module  
3. **even_odd.py** – Check whether a number is even or odd  
4. **largest_of_three.py** – Find the largest among three numbers using `if-elif-else`  
6. **leap_year_check.py** – Determine whether a given year is a leap year  
7. **grade_calculator.py** – Take marks and assign grade using conditions
